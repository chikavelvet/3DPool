## Failures
We refactored a lot, but not enough. A lot of our code is mid-transition, but it was hard to find the time/motivation to improve it when it works for what we need the way it is. In general, we finished the main requirements of the project early with the intention of having plenty of time for polish, but as it went we ended up prioritizing other things over improving our game. Our game is still hard, though we tried to make it a little bit easier (we'll talk about that in the successes portion). One main reason for the difficulty is unfortunately a pesky bug we've been encountering but have yet to completely solve: sometimes when you hit the ball it goes off in a crazy direction that isn't the direction you hit it! It happens somewhat rarely, but often enough to be a frustrating nuisance. We've spent hours trying to fix it, and it seems like we've limited it for the most part, but the occasional renegade ball pops up every now and then. We can say that it "simulates natural human error" and is a feature, but that's a lie.

## Successes 
We made our game much nicer than it was before. This especially goes to the graphics and GUI components: it's just so much nicer to look at than it was before. We also made efforts on improving the difficulty balance, by reducing the number of balls and adding a guide-line (which came out rather well using the particle system). We also improved the code structure significantly (though not enough, as we mentioned before). The multiplayer isn't the most exciting in the world, but it works! It's consistent! And it's actually fun to compete with eachother to try to tame and corral the wild balls back into their pockets. The main menu GUI and multiplayer lobby GUI are both nice enough, and we even added a background to the main menu. We worked a lot on the ball colors and textures to improve them over what we had before, and we played around with lighting and shadows until we got it how we wanted (we decided to remove shadows, because they seemed odd in the setting). Overall, it could use more improvement, but we built a solid game.
