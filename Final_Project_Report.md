# ThreeDPool : Casey, Rishi, Trey : Final Project Report

## Failures
First of all, our game isn't really fun. Most of that comes from the difficulty; it's very hard to aim. To counter that, we made the pockets large, but it's still pretty hard. The biggest other problem is the sound. It's not terrible, but on the initial break, or whenever many balls are colliding at once, the sound can be overwhelming. Overall, the structuring of the code was difficult to maintain. We frequently ended up noticing that there was structure in place that we could use, and had to refactor our code extensively. Even in the end, a lot of our code ended up in the main ThreeDPool.cpp file, when things like user input or GUI elements could have been separated into other classes. In the future, we would want to focus more on initial software design; in this project, we kind of built it on the fly with limited pre-planning, and that lack of oversight showed.

One thing to note is our lack of gravity. Though gravity was a requirement for the project, from a game design standpoint, it didn't make sense to put gravity into our 3D pool game (it would just be 2D pool in a big room). Adding global gravity would be one line of code, but we intentionally left that out.

## Successes 
Overall, we made a game! We have physics, we have sounds, we have textures, gameplay, and even a win condition. We collected a bunch of different sounds for ball-ball collisions, ball-stick collisions, pockets, etc., and we also implemented background music. We have a neat free-cam that works fairly well, and in general the camera and stick movement came out really well. It's also very satisfying to shoot the cue ball and break the pyramid (and in general to hit balls). Charging up the stick is natural-looking enough that it almost seems like an animation (but it's actually all controlled through physics simulation). We implemented collision masking so that the stick doesn't collide with walls or non-cue balls. We successfully integrated external libraries, like the SDL sound and CEGUI. We made our own textures for the balls, stick, and table, and it came out looking nice.
